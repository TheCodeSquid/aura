aura \- A package manager for Arch Linux and the AUR
.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SY aura
.I OPERATION
\*[multi-optional OPTIONS]
\*[multi-optional targets]
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B aura
is a multilingual package manager for Arch Linux.
.
It connects to both the official Arch repositories and to the
Arch User Repositories (AUR),
allowing easy control of all packages on an Arch system.
.
Aura allows
.I all
pacman operations and provides
.I new
custom ones for dealing with AUR packages.
.
.P
Unlike pacman, it is never necessary to prefix aura with sudo. Aura is
internally aware of when sudo is necessary and will prompt the user.
.
.P
Commands below labeled (Pacman) are wrapped Pacman commands and are not
documented further here. See \fBman pacman\fR for those.
.
.P
This document is strictly a description of Aura's command-line interface. For
in-depth usage examples and more detailed discussions of various system
management tasks, see \fBinfo aura\fR.
.
.SH OPERATIONS
.
.TP
.BR \-A ", " \-\-aursync ", " aur " \*[packages-optional]"
.
Perform actions involving the
.BR A UR.
.
Default action installs packages from the AUR.
.
After building, the built
.I *.pkg.tar.xz
file is moved to the package cache and installed from there.
.
This allows for easy AUR package downgrading.
.
.IP
Packages are built within a local directory as the user who invoked Aura.
However, when Aura is run as the \fBroot\fR user, actual package building will
occur as the \fBnobody\fR user within \fB/tmp\fR. See \fB\-\-build\fR and
\fB\-\-builduser\fR for how to modify this behaviour.
.
.TP
.BR -B ", " \-\-backup ", " backup
.
Manage the saving and restoring of the global package state.
.
Default action stores a record of all currently installed packages and their
versions.
.
.TP
.BR -C ", " \-\-cache ", " cache " \*[packages-optional]"
.
Perform actions involving the package
.BR C ache.
.
Default action downgrades specified
.IR packages .
.
.IP
This process is interactive, allowing the user to choose from any previous
version they have available in the package cache.
.
.TP
.BR -D ", " \-\-database ", " database " \*[packages-optional]"
.
(Pacman) Operate on the package database.
.

.
.TP
.BR \-O ", " \-\-orphans ", " orphans " \*[packages-optional]"
.
Perform actions involving
.BR O rphan
packages.
.

.IP
Detailed information involving Aura's configuration can be found in the Aura
Guide via \fBinfo aura\fR under the heading \fBConfiguration\fR.
.
.TP
.BR deps
.
Display a dependency graph of given packages. Useful for identifying why a
certain package exists on your system. Outputs a \fB.png\fR file to the current
directory by default, but with \fB\-\-open\fR will output to \fB/tmp\fR and open
the image in the default viewer instead.
.
.IP
If the image isn't opening in the viewer you prefer, consider altering it in
\fI~/.config/mimeapps.list\fR. For instance:
.
.RSAMPLE
[Default Applications]
image/png=swayimg.desktop
.ERSAMPLE
.
.IP
The available \fB.desktop\fR entries can be found in \fI/usr/share/applications/\fR.
.
.TP
.BR free
.
View the state of Free Software installed on the system. This displays a list of
packages that have non-FOSS or otherwise unknown licenses. For the purposes of

.SH AUR SYNC OPTIONS (\fR\-A\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-delmakedeps
.
Uninstalls build dependencies that are no longer required after installing the
main package.
.
This prevents the creation of orphan packages.
.
Also note that while the package itself will be uninstalled,
its package file will remain in the cache.
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean
.
After a package's tarball has been built and copied to the package cache,
delete its build directory immediately.
.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-info " \*[packages]"
.
View information about AUR
.IR packages .
.
.TP

Open the given package's AUR page in a browser.
.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-pkgbuild " \*[packages]"
.
View PKGBUILDs of AUR
.IR packages .
.
Use this before installing new packages to confirm that the build scripts
aren't doing anything fishy.
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-search " \*[multi word]"

.RS
.
.  TP
.  B \-\-abc
.
Sorts results alphabetically.

.  BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
.
Only print matching package names.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-r ", " \-\-reverse
.

.
.RE
.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-sysupgrade

.
Show available upgrades, but do not perform them.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-k ", " \-\-diff
.
View diffs of PKGBUILDs before building.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-\-ignore \ \fIpackage\fR

.  BR \-\-git
.
Rebuild all git/svn/hg/etc. packages as well.
.
.RE
.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-provides \ \fIpackage\fR
.
Search the AUR for packages that "provide" some package identity. The same
suboptions available for \fI\-s\fR also apply here. Example:
.
.RSAMPLE
aura -Av gcc
.ERSAMPLE
.
.IP
This would yield a list of packages that "are" gcc for the purposes of
dependency resolution.
.
.TP
.BR \-w ", " \-\-clone " \*[packages]"
.
Clone the repository of the given package(s).
.
.
.TP
.BR \-y ", " \-\-refresh

.TP
.B \-\-hotedit
.
Before building, prompt the user if they wish to view/edit the
.IR PKGBUILD ,
as well as any
.IR .install " or " .patch
files.
.
However, research into packages (and by extension, their PKGBUILDs) should be
done by the user before any building occurs.
.
Please use
.BR \-Ai " and " \-Ap
for this,
as they will be much faster at presenting information than searching the AUR
website manually.
.
.TP
.B \-\-nocheck
.
(Makepkg) Do not consider checkdeps when resolving dependencies, nor run the
check() function of the PKGBUILD.
.
.TP
.B \-\-shellcheck
.
Run shellcheck on PKGBUILDs before building.
.
.TP
.B \-\-skipdepcheck
.
Perform no dependency solving.

Consider this when using
.B \-\-hotedit
to avoid building annoying dependencies that aren't necessary for your special
use-case.
.
.TP
.B \-\-skipinteg
.
(Makepkg) Do not perform any verification checks on source files.
.
.TP
.B \-\-skippgpcheck

Will remove any that weren't installed at the time.
.
.SH PACKAGE CACHE OPTIONS (\fR\-C\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-backup \c
.I " path "
.
Backup the package cache to a given directory.
.
The given directory must already exist.
.
During copying, progress will be shown.
.
If the copy takes too long,
you may want to reduce the number of older versions of each package by using
.BR \-Cc .
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean \c
.I " versions-to-retain "
.
Retains a given number of package versions for each package,
and deletes the rest from the package cache.
.
Count is made from the most recent version, so using:
.
.RSAMPLE
aura -Cc 3
.ERSAMPLE
.
.IP
would save the three most recent versions of each package file.
.
Giving the number 0 as an argument is identical to
.BR \-Scc .

Delete invalid tarballs from the cache. Here "invalid" means "can't be opened by ALPM".
.
.TP
.BR \-y ", " \-\-refresh
.
Download tarballs of installed packages that are missing from the cache. This is
important for interaction with \fB\-Br\fR, which can't function if expected
tarballs are missing. Use \fBaura check\fR to confirm the status of both the
cache and the saved snapshots.
.
.SH LOGFILE OPTIONS (\fR\-L\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-after \ \fIYYYY-MM-DD\fR

Note that these flags are not the expected way to alter Aura's language for
normal usage. If your locale is set to something that Aura recognizes, it will
automatically alter its output language. Otherwise, you're able to set the
\fBlanguage\fR field within configuration. The available language codes can be
viewed in the output of \fBaura stats --lang\fR.
.
.P
See the \fBLocalisation\fR topic within \fBinfo aura\fR for instructions on
adding a new language to Aura.
.
.SH PRO TIPS
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
After first installation, run:
.
.RSAMPLE
aura conf --gen > ~/.config/aura/config.toml
.ERSAMPLE
.
.IP
to generate a configuration file that you can customise.
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
Use \fBaura check\fR to keep an eye on some aspects of the health of your
system.
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
If you build a package and then choose not to install it,
the built package file will still be moved to the cache.
You can then install it whenever you want with
.BR \-C .
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
Research packages using
.BR \-Ai \ ( \-\-info )
and
.BR \-Ap \ ( \-\-pkgbuild )!
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
When upgrading, use
.B \-Akua
instead of just
.BR \-Au .
.
This will remove makedeps, as well as show PKGBUILD diffs before building. The
effects of \fB\-k\fR and \fB\-a\fR can however be enabled permanently in Aura's
config.
.
.SH SEE ALSO
.
.BR pacman (8),
.BR pacman.conf (5),
.BR makepkg (8)
.
.P
Apart from the various flags described here, the Aura Manual is available via
.B info aura
and contains more detailed usage information.
.
.SH BUGS
.
It is not recommended to install non-AUR packages with pacman or aura.
.
Aura will assume they are AUR packages during a
.B \-Au
and attempt to upgrade them.
.
If a name collision occurs (that is, if there is a legitimate AUR package with
the same name as the one you installed) previous installations could be
overwritten.
.
.P
You may occasionally notice that Aura doesn't detect new package versions
immediately after they are updated on the AUR. This is because Aura fetches
package metadata from a dedicated server, not the AUR directly. The dedicated
server refreshes its database every hour, so in these cases we ask you to be
patient.
